## Project Overview

**SportHub** is a web-based sports application that helps fans track games across
multiple sports from a single place. The app lets users:

- View upcoming and recent games for multiple sports (NBA, NFL, soccer, MLB).
- Filter games by **sport** and **date**.
- Create a fan account and mark teams as **favorites**.
- View a **My Favorites** page showing upcoming games for their favorite teams.
- (Admin – planned) Manage teams and games in the schedule.

The project emphasizes planning, documentation, and tooling:
**GitHub, Jira, TestRail, Docker, and LaTeX**, as required by CS3338.

## Formal Objectives

1. **Unified Schedule View**  
   Provide a single web interface where users can view schedules for multiple
   sports without switching between different apps or websites.

2. **Personalized Favorites**  
   Let fans mark teams as favorites and quickly see upcoming games for those
   teams on a dedicated **My Favorites** page.

3. **Full Toolchain Demonstration**  
   Use professional tools (GitHub, Jira, TestRail, Docker, LaTeX) to model a
   small but complete software engineering workflow: requirements, design,
   implementation, testing, and deployment.

4. **Extendable Architecture**  
   Design the system so that live sports APIs, richer stats, or notifications
   can be added later without rewriting the whole app.

## Why SportHub Matters

There are many sports sources online, but casual fans often just want to know:

> *“When do my teams play next?”*

SportHub:

- Centralizes schedules from multiple sports into one simple interface.
- Lets users focus on **their** teams via favorites instead of browsing full
  league schedules.
- Serves as a teaching example of how to design, document, test, and deploy a
  small web system using modern tools and good engineering practices.

## Tech Stack & Architecture (High-Level)

- **Frontend:** React single-page application (Home / All Games, Teams, My Favorites, Login/Register).
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express REST API.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (users, teams, games, favorites).
- **Containerization:** `docker-compose.yml` managing:
  - `frontend` service
  - `backend` service
  - `db` service (PostgreSQL)
  - optional `nginx` reverse proxy
- **Documentation:** All main documents written in LaTeX and stored under `docs/`.
