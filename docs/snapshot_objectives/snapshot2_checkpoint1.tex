\section*{Snapshot 2 – Checkpoint 1 Objective}

For Snapshot 2, our goal is to complete the first large feature of SportHub:
viewing games by sport and date.

\subsection*{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement a basic frontend page that lists games
        with sport, teams, date, and time.
  \item Add simple filters for sport and date.
  \item Create a backend endpoint (with mock data or a simple database table)
        to return a list of games.
  \item Update the SDD, SRS, user manual, and design spec
        to describe the “View Games” feature.
  \item Set up TestRail and create test cases for listing and filtering games.
  \item Update the workflow diagram to show the flow for viewing games.
\end{itemize}
