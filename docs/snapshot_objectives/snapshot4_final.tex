\section*{Snapshot 4 – Final Objective}

For Snapshot 4 (original due date), our goal is to finish SportHub,
clean up the project, and reflect on future work.

\subsection*{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Polish the UI for all pages (games list, favorites, admin).
  \item Complete admin tools for adding, editing, or removing games.
  \item Fix bugs found in TestRail and finalize all test runs.
  \item Update SDD, SRS, user manual, design spec, and workflow diagram
        to match the final implementation.
  \item Add a reflection section describing what was completed,
        what could not be finished, and ideas for future work
        (more sports, live score APIs, authentication, etc.).
  \item Make sure the Docker setup runs the full system and the README
        explains how to start the app.
\end{itemize}
